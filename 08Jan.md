# 1857 and Its Aftermath
[Ch. 9 and 10]
The years leading up to 1857 saw a number of small, localized revolts. The extreme localization of these mutinies arose out of the lack of mass literacy and mass media.

The various local alliances and affiliations in 1857 were:

* The landowners in Punjab and Awadh were in favour of the British, as the major revenue for these areas comes from sepoy incomes.
* The Nizam is in favour of the British, as they want to avoid power going to the hands of the Marathas, the only other major player in central India.
* The Afghans wish to join the Nizam, but the Nizam is against this alliance.
* Smaller land-holding peasants were against the British, as they added an extra layer of taxation on top of the zamindars. The landless peasants fought less strongly.
* The sepoys resented the General Service Enlistment Act of 1856, which brought together people of different castes and communities.

Thus the 1857 war was a feudal reaction to British rule, and not led by the traditional élite. It was underpinned by the *bhaichara* of the subordinate classes, and as such the first instance of patriotism and anti-racism in the subcontinent.  
The British retaliated with brutal punishments and torture, in the place of summary execution, as a display of power.

After the British quelled the mutiny (which cost 50 million pounds), there was major social and political reorganization.  
Benefits accrued to Punjabi and Awadhi landowners for their support of the British – for example, the investment in irrigation in Punjab – which cemented a major alliance of the British.  
Alliances were established with the royalty of the princely states, by providing them pensions and the privy purse; they thus eliminated the need for popular sanction from the monarchy.  
The military was also classified according to caste, creating the Gurkha, Sikh, Rajputana, etc. Regiments. This created and perpetuated the stereotype of militia among these classes, while weakening the perception of other communities like the Bengalis; it also instantiated this distinction by allocating resources on this basis. This had a huge affect due to the reliance on military income in an agrarian society.  
The Indian-to-European ratio was also controlled after the mutiny, preventing it from rising more than 2:1. Whole sections of the army, like the artillery, became solely European, to prevent the rising of another Mangal Pandey.

By far the most major change, however, was that India changed hands from the East India Company to the Crown – it ceased to be a private holding and became a colony. The economy moved from the silver-based rupee to the bullion, and the subcontinent was integrated into a global financial market under the Crown, which led to a balance of trade surplus.  
The newly export-oriented agriculture, now aligned to cash crops, led to a huge outflow of resources from the subcontinent. This impoverishes farmers at the ground level, while benefiting zamindars and landowners. This export surplus funded the military, the railway, and several other expenses of the Crown, and was therefore crucial to the Crown's wealth. The 1870s to 1890s drained 5-7% of India's resources to Britain.

The British also set up local self-governments to address the resentment arising out of disenfranchisement. These had British officials in the majority, and were run by taxing states and provinces. Most importantly, the units that form the basis of these councils are constituted on the basis of religion and caste – they are *supra-local*. Categories such as the "depressed classes" and "Indian Muslims" were created, causing interests defined by these classifications to supersede real administrative concerns of the people, denying any unified sense of "Indianness." 1909 also saw the establishment of separate electorates for elections to these bodies.  
This arrangement of local government dictated the terms of the freedom struggle that was to follow, starting with increased representation in local government.

The education system, too, was set up at this point, designed to produce Indian clerks trained in English. The first department of English literature was set up in an Indian university – although the material was popular, the presentation of authors like Jane Austen or Shakespeare as "classical" and "worth studying" engendered a sense of inferiority to Europeans in the educated Indian classes, while still making them proficient in English.

At this point, the British perception of the Hindu educated middle class was that they were too assertive, while the Muslim élite was a natural ally (having been rulers of the subcontinent for centuries). The Muslim lower classes, however, were too prone to religious revivalism, and the British stayed wary of them as well as the Hindu middle class.  
This is also the period in which the Indian middle and upper classes, educated in Europe, learn of equality and fraternity, and begin to critically view their religious and cultural roots through the lens of Western rationality and ideals. Reform movements, against practices like sati, or espousing women's education, start from these classes, who are closely associated (culturally and socially) with the British. These affect styles of dress, housekeeping, education, and other fundamental aspects of life in India.  
This time also saw the establishment of the Aligarh Muslim University by Sir Sayyad Ahmad Khan, as a place for "modern education." Subjects as diverse as the sciences, history, and modern languages were taught alongside Urdu, Turkish and Farsi. He proposed the two-nation theory, arguing for a Muslim ummah, or brotherhood, *within* the Indian nation, but as a separate entity. The ummah consists primarily of the lower economic classes – professions like shoemakers, butchers and stoneworkers – who converted after the arrival of the Mughals due to poor treatment by the higher Hindu castes. This is the nature of the two-nation theory in its original form.
