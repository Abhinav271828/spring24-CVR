# The Interwar Period
The immediate post-World War I period was a time of great unrest, with the biggest agitations since 1857. Gandhi's rise to popularity in this period was due to his astute sense of politics and his mass appeal. He began at this point to finetune nonviolence as a way to resist the British.  
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre heralded the decay of the Empire during this period, being recognized even in England as an unnecessary act of violence.

At this point, Gandhi expressed support for the Arab claim to Palestine and a token Caliphate. Through these causes, he proclaimed the view that there was no contradiction between being Indian and being Muslim.
