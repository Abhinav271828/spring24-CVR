# Saadat Hasan Manto
Manto was an Indian, living in Bombay at the time of Partition, but he shifted to Pakistan soon after.

## Toba Tek Singh
Manto uses the setting of *Toba Tek Singh* to point out the madness of Partition, highlighting the irony of the Inter-Dominion Treaty in the opening paragraph of the story. He uses the words and actions of the inhabitants of the asylum to depict the plights of people belonging to various classes, religions and regions, emphasizing the considerations of a group of people who were unconcerned by the political figures and their tussling that led to the Partition. It reflects the uncertainty and confusion of a time when borders were changing and national identities were being formed.

The name of the place Toba Tek Singh is used to highlight the organic connection of a man, especially a farmer, with the land that he comes from, tills and depends on.
