# The Muslim League, Gandhi, War, and the INC
The early 1900s and 1910s were a period of rising nationalism – at this time only defined by anti-colonial feeling, and not oneness. The Morley-Minto reforms and other administrative measures made religion and caste predominant aspects of the Indian identity, and began a practice of provincializing politics that continues to this day.

Around the beginning of World War I, Gandhi returned to India. He espoused practices of self-dependence – both in the individual and the national sense. He quickly became the most important mass mobilizer in the history of the freedom struggle, in part due to the times; he was able to exploit the resentment stewing throughout the subcontinent for this mass mobilization.  
In thought and ideology, he had more of a Victorian outlook than anything else, and maintained what are by modern standards deeply problematic beliefs.

When the war started, it raised the question of Indian support of the British effort. The INC negotiated this debate (between Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on one side and Gandhi on the other), by using the British demand for Indian military as leverage for concessions.  
The war effort led to huge upheavals in the country's economy. The increased expense caused famine and hyper-inflation, and the disruption in English transport lines impacted imports (benefiting local industrialists). The immediate post-war period saw fluctuation in the value of the rupee coinciding with the European depression. In 1922, the Crown granted fiscal autonomy to India.

At this point, Muslims as a class considered the INC their political representation. The Muslim League was the party of the landowning Muslims, which did not represent the interests of the rest. The INC united the moderates and the extreme nationalists. In the Lucknow Pact of 1916, the Congress accepted separate electorates in order to keep the emphasis on anti-colonialism.  
In 1919, the British wanted to appease the moderates in order to keep the peace in India. They exploited the nature of provincial/central administrative separation to restrict decision-making to a few leaders at the top. The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms implemented nominal, numerical changes in the electoral structure while still maintaining the practical categories like Muslims, landlords and depressed classes. However, the wartime Rowlatt Act (enabling arrest without just cause) was not rescinded.
