# Kafer
The word *kafir* can be understood in two ways. One way is a scriptural interpretation – a *kafir* is one who does not identify with, practise or have faith in Islamic scripture. This is not necessarily derogatory; it is simply a word for someone who does not belong to the community and should be converted.  
A different way to consider the word is that a *kafir* is someone who has gone rogue, who has to be tamed. The difference between the two senses lies in the attitude towards the *kafir* – one of engagement versus one of belligerence.

The story keeps up a string of references to animals and nature, underlining the connection of the people to the land.

The courtyard of Hashim's house, where people are gathered, smoking hookah and discussing the events of the evening. The courtyard is an example of a liminal space, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither gendered nor non-gendered.

The details of Paran's attempted escape and his killing raise the question of who the *kafer* of this story really is – Hashim, Paran, or his killers?

The last part of the story loses much in translation. Hashim's reference to the "gold" he lost in the earth is a reference to the connection between the land, prosperity and near and dear ones, a weighty metaphor in Bangla.
We also note the phrasing "we've just lifted [Kironi];" this has connotations of rape or murder in Bangla when applied to a person.
