## Before: Causes
* Uniqueness of 1857:

### Quit India Movement
- Biggest civilian uprising since 1857
- Orchestrated by lower ranking leaders
- Began in urban areas; repressed
    - Spread to countryside in Sept
    - Admin collapsed
    - Repressed by spring '43
- Muslim majority provinces and right-wingers avoided

    - Cabinet mission in spring '46 to discuss the terms and shape of Indian independence

# The Partition of India and the Creation of Pakistan
* The contradictions and structural peculiarities of Indian society and politics eventually led to the creation of Pakistan
* British social enumerators invested Hinduism and Islam with a supra-local significance and cohesion never achieved before
    - Identities were redefined not simply as a function of skilful social engineering by the colonial masters but also as part of a process of the multifaceted resistance against colonial rule

## Indian Muslim Identity
* Definition of IM triggered contradictions
    - But identities were formed by social and economic relations linked to colonial rule
    - Coherence and articulation
        - Reformist mvmts w/ ideological links w/ West Asia
        - But fractured by class, region, rural-urban
        - Doctrinal, sectarian, heterodox divisions
* Role of British construction
    - End of 19c: British officials saw Muslims as a separate political community
    - Assertive Hindu educated class; revivalist Muslim lower class
        - British allied w/ Muslim landed elite
    - SAK proposed 2NT to impress political importance of Muslims
    - Separate electorates: 1882, 1909, 1919
        - Main aim was to confine politics to the provinces
        - Muslim politicians could focus on competing among themselves
    - Muslims avoided pan-India organization until last decade
    - In colonial representative system, supra-communal alliances resisted association with AIML
    - Khilafatists supported Gandhi
    - 30s reforms were good for Muslims in majority provinces but bad for the rest – eliminated British safeguard

## The Demand for Pakistan
* Minority provinces' Muslim politicians turned to Jinnah
    - But lacked support due to British grip on centre
    - AIML could not garner support in majority provinces or with Congress
    - Won 4.4% of Muslim vote
    - Congress needed no support from League
        - Except in Punjab (Union), Bengal (KPP)
        - Sikandar Hayat Khan, Fazlul Haq lent support to AIML under fears of Hindu Raj
    - Muslim provinces disliked strong-centre federal arrangement
    - Iqbal called for Muslim state in NW
        - Chaudhri Rahmat Ali: "Pakistan"
* The war
    - Viceroy used AIML as an excuse to contest INC's claim of representing India
    - 1940: AIML demanded Muslim states
        - Rejected "communalism" and advanced AIML nationalism
        - Drew strength from Muslim antipathy to INC
        - Imprecise on degree of sovereignty
        - Reciprocal arrangement for minority protection
    - "problem is one of sharing power rather than qualifiying the terms on which power is exercised by a majority"
    - Unitary India formed by partnership between Pakistan and Hindustan

## The Success of the AIML
* Jinnah had to garner support in P&B
    - Mainly landed magnates in charge of local politics
    - Started souring relations between communities in these provinces
        - Jinnah needed agreement of minorities
        - Cripps Mission almost brought out the inconsistency
        - CRR proposed Pakistan taken from Muslim-majority districts of P&B, still united
            - Jinnah dismissed this
    - 1945-6: AIML won all Muslim seats to the central assembly
        - But this was not backed by a specific agenda
        - Based on
            - alliances of convenience with local leaders
            - Unionist anti-agricultural war exigencies
            - famine relief by Abul Hashim faction
        - Depicted as mandate for Pakistan, from unidivided P&B
        - Minorities were still wary
        - State assemblies were still not AIML

## The Refusal for Pakistan
* 1946 Cabinet Mission
    - Three-tiered pan-Indian federation
        - Grouping of provinces at second tier
    - But INC called for authority at centre
    - So AIML's choice was
        - Undivided India without guarantee of central Muslim representation
        - Sovereign Pakistan, partitioned P&B
            - Would not receive significant share of central assets
    - Jinnah rejected latter
        - Former was decided upon
        - But Nehru was opposing the grouping
        - Jinnah panicked
* Direct Action Day: 16/08/1946
    - Sep: Congress joined interim govt at centre
        - Oct: AIML joined
    - Violence spread in Calcutta, Noakhali, Bihar, Punjab in Jan
    - Peasant rebellion in Telangana
* Attlee announced departure by 30/06/48
    - HM demanded partition of P&B
    - Congress echoed
* Plan for unified Bengal was ditched
* Mountbatten unveiled plan for partition
    - District legislators voted
    - Congress whip voted in favour

* INC refused to let AIML make claims on behalf of Muslims in minority provinces
    - Cast partition as secession of Muslim-majority areas from the Union
    - Decisive political abortion of 2NT
* The making of Pakistan was decided by the particularisms of the Muslim provinces, not the supra-local Islamic sentiment
    - Contradictory logic of emphasis on provincial politics along with communally compartmentalized electorates

# Nineteen Forty-Seven: Memories and Meanings
* Pakistan became the largest Muslim state in the world (60mn)
* India became the largest Muslim-minority country in the world (40mn)

* It is claimed that Pakistan took Islamic ideology as its most important impulse
    - Jinnah was a proponent of HMU
    - Stood for a common INC-AIML programme
    - Gave no definition to Pakistan
* Was the AIML tactic sufficient to commit Pakistan to a theocratic state?
    - Religion-as-culture was important
    - Religion-as-ideology? Not so much
    - AIML support relied on local bosses; there was no local or regional Muslim politics

* Jinnah's strategy misfired
    - Underestimated the hurry of the British
    - Underestimated INC's commitment to MG
    - Lack of control over followers
* The demand for Pakistan was Jinnah's path to all-India politics
    - His sentiments were more oriented to the INC than to his own followers
    - He had to recast himself greatly
    - Declared Pakistan a secular country
* The postcolonial state has suppressed these aspects of his ideas

* INC easily claimed the label of "Indian nationalist"
* Only INC-supporting Muslims qualified as "nationalist Muslims"
* Centre-region contradictions were obscured by the "settled" communal divide
* Myth of Gandhian success was propagated

* Disjunction between meanings and memories of partition
    - Why dominion status? Why partition?
    - INC laid claim to Delhi, princely states
    - Sovereignty was possibly only through this compromise of unity and independence
* The same compromise extends to the principle socio-economic betterment
    - India's poor are not free
* Legacy of the expediency
    - Federal dilemma
    - Threats to secularism
    - Class, caste conflicts
    - Pakistan military disputes
* Romanticization of Raj in 1980s
