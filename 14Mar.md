# The Partitions of Memory
This work investigates how the conditions of media affects and informs what people are ready to remember. Suvir Kaul uses the example of nuclear weaponry to demonstrate the fundamental misguidedness of the political story of Partition, by pointing out the fact that nuclear war would inevitably mean the destruction of both countries.

Both the texts reveal how to understand the stories of survivors and victims of the events of Partition. They point out, for instance, how women describe the day-to-day minutiae of the horrors, while men tend to talk about the big-picture politics of the situation.

We also see the particular nature of the horrors, geared towards the identity of the victims; this is illustrated, specifically, by the fact that 200 women were made to dance naked in the Golden Temple throughout the night. This event also demonstrates the gendered nature of the violence.

The popular media surrounding Partition is mostly sanitized and politically directed (in both nations).
