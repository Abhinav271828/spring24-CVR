# 1857 and Its Aftermath (recap)
[Identity and Belonging]  
The British practice of taking censuses from the 1880s dictated a huge reorganization of community identities. Many members downtrodden or marginalized communities reported their names or castes as the locally powerful or privileged groups, *e.g.*, Pasmanda and Ashrafi Muslims.

[Economic Drain]  
When the railways were set up by the British, this was done with the help of raw materials imported from Europe, and aided in the transport of materials to be exported abroad. Thus the ancillary industries usually stimulated by the setting up of railways were not so benefited due to this practice. This helped Britain overcome its trade deficit with the protectionist US and continental Europe.  
The export of raw materials from Britain to India was done on the basis of pound sterling bills, which would be given to British tradesmen in exchange for raw materials, and which could be used in the credit market. Thus India developed into a market for the Lancashire mill lobby, without customs duties or protective tariffs for the Indian mills.

[Local Government]  
The local government set up by the British in this era was primarily European, although it included one "official" and one "non-official" Indian, who were elected. This set the subjects apart as blocks of interests fundamentally opposed to those of the rulers (Rajat Kanta Ray). This, in conjunction with the famines, droughts, poverty and racial injustice of the times, created deep dissatisfaction with colonial rule by the end of the century, and this period saw the rise of the demand for swaraj. The Indian National Congress (formed 1885), the party of moderates – largely populated by urban middle-class industrialists – championed this demand.  
The Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 partially assuaged these demands, while at the same time exploiting religion- and caste-based divisions by institutionalizing them as constituencies. These *interpellations* redrew identities of the subjects of the empire in a manner that persisted until long after independence. This, and census manipulation, were ways that European racist and colonialist ideals were internalized into Indian society.
