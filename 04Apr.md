# Saadat Hasan Manto (contd.)
## Khol Do
The archetype of the teenage daughter seen through the eyes of the father is a common theme across Manto's stories. Comparing Sakina of *Khol Do* with Roop Kaur of *Toba Tek Singh*, we note the different ways this archetype is realized – with or without physical presence, Hindu or Muslim, etc.

*Khol Do*'s ending points out how people's presentation and perception of themselves were changed by the traumatic events of Partition. Sakina's near-lifeless body's response to the phrase "खोल दो" is to simply undo her waistband – she now perceives her function as only an object of rape.
