# Mammo
*Mammo* was written by Khalid Mohammed, an important film critic/journalist in the 90s. It is the second of three movies written by Mohammed.

Many things about *Mammo* set it apart from mainstream popular Bollywood cinema – it has only one song, and three main characters, and no love interest. It, however, makes several references to the media of the time.

Mammo's backstory tells us about the condition of women during Partition, especially those without sons. Her character is contrasted with Fayyazi, being more effusive and colourful. Their history – as the issue over the *haveli* in Panipat reveals – is of landed aristocracy, before the migration to an urban setting.  
Anwari and her husband also depict the caste question in the context of new wealth – the class of people who made money from business in the 90s – specifically, Anwari's husband, known to Fayyazi and Mammo as "the cobbler" despite being a successful leather goods exporter.

The scene with Shantabai and her husband is used to describe the Bombay that Khalid Mohammed grew up in; the gully is lined by posters of various popular movies, and songs play in the background. Mammo also tells the story here of how she crossed from India to Lahore.

In the scene with the train, the officers who put Mammo on the train have a conversation about the discontent of their life – one regretting that his job makes him tear people apart, and the other that people don't stay where they should. We also see the culture of "adopting" fellow-passengers on long train journeys, through the young blind boy entrusted to her charge. The depiction of train culture is an example of the liminal spaces that the movie focuses on in many ways.
