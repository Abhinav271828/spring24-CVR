The first parts of the story paints the protagonist, Satyabrata Lahiri, as a *bhadralok* – the educated, middle-class, intelligentsia. To understand this better, we must go into the nature and origins of the middle class; as a category, it arose after the French Revolution, coinciding with the Industrial Revolution. It came out of the need for services rather than materials, and so consists of a group that does not produce goods, but only services. It depends on education; in fact, it was the beginning of the middle class that precipitated the need for mass education.  
It is typically in the interest of the middle class to keep the upper class (the owners of the means of production, *e.g.*, the industrialist or landowner) in place, so that their income (as a share of that of the upper class) is assured. This makes the middle class, typically, the most conservative of classes; their interests are usually served by maintaining the status quo.  
The essence of the *bhadralok* identity is this aspect of the middle-class – the high reward associated with *maintenance* (or uplifitng) *of position*. Here, "position" is usually defined by having a livelihood based on intellectual work, rather than manual labour.  
This phenomenon created a huge problem for the East Pakistani *bhadralok* refugee – those who were, before Partition, the upper-caste, middle-class, middle- to low-income families. After fleeing their homes, their land, and their native places, they had no assurance of being recognised as the gentlefolk they were. The reception that West Bengal offered to the East Pakistani refugee was not welcoming – many of them lost land, money and their families.  
Thus, the story shows us a picture of a man holding on to his *bhadrata* as hard as possible, staying on his land (his "base"), and living with the utmost thriftiness. His panic at the visit of two strange men and the need to go the thana to the house is another mark of the precariousness of his existence.

Satyabrata's internal monologue, the first part of the story, gives us a caustic, jaded attitude to life. He sees his job as prostitution, and his life's goal as saving enough money for his own funeral.

The house that Satyabrata and his family live in, according to the study, is owned by someone else, currently living in East Pakistan; and it is revealed that it was bought from a person who was only safeguarding the house for the real owner. We can see this as a metaphor for the entire subcontinent itself – the British "handing over" property that was not theirs to hand over.
