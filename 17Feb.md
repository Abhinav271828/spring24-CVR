# The Second World War
When the war started, the Congress demanded immediate independence in exchange for help. However, the AIML opposed the Congress's hegemony over the "Indian" and "nationalist" identity – Jinnah called Congress nationalism a "conjurer's trick." He needed to formulate a unified Muslim voice.  
In order to mobilize support in Muslim-majority provinces, he took recourse to religion. Students from AMU took the voice of AIML and Jinnah to rural areas. In the 1945-6 elections, the AILM won all Muslim seats at the Centre and a majority in several provinces (including Bengal).

At this point, the British proposed a three-tiered federal arrangement of undivided India with a weak federal centre; there would be Muslim provinces but no guarantees of Muslim representation at the Centre.  
The Congress countered this proposal with a sovereign Pakistan, which would include the western parts of Punjab and the eastern parts of Bengal. Jinnah rejected this suggestion.  
The Congress also began courting the Frontier Pathans and Baluchis – the fringe Muslim groups – to undermine Jinnah's unificiation of India's Muslims.

In 1946, Nehru took over from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad as Congress President. He announced that the agreement that had been arrived at with Jinnah may not hold after Independence. Jinnah withdrew from the Cabinet in protest.  
He then called for a *Direct Action Day* in Calcutta, on 16th August 1946 (during Ramzan), in demand for a "nation within the nation" – *not* a sovereign country. Suhrawardy, the AIML CM of Bengal, asked for the day to be declared a holiday; the Centre refused. Kiron Shankar Roy (the Congress CM of Bengal) and the Hindu Mahasabha explicitly asked local businesses to not shut down. The Army was finally called in on 18th August.  
The riots spread to Noakhali, in Chittagong, in October and November, and Bihar on Dussehra.

By early 1947, the British were in a hurry to leave. However, at this point, the plan was to leave in June 1948. The Hindu Mahasabha then demanded the partition of Punjab and Bengal, which Nehru backs.  
Even so, Suhrawardy, Kiran Shankar Roy and Sarat Bose reach an understanding for a united independent Bengal in May, to which Gandhi and Jinnah agree but which Patel and Nehru oppose. In June 1947, the majority of Congress legislators rejected partition when it was put to vote; Nehru and Patel remained adamant, however.

In June, Cyril Radcliffe was given 3 months to draw the new border, having never visited the areas under question. Jinnah remained against the idea of Partition until this point.
