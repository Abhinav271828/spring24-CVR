# The Anti-Colonial Call for Freedom
The post-mutiny period of the 19th century saw the rise of reformist and revivalist movements, influencing definitions of regions, cultures and religions, all aspects of the Indian identity. Thus, this was an extremely important period in the formation of Indian modernity.

The early 1870s witnessed the decline the Hindu reform movements, ending with the movement to change the age of consent in 1871. An important aspect of the reformist vs. revivalist battle is the matter of territory (including women) being public or private – is what one does at home their business alone, or the business of the community? During this period, a number of minor skirmishes, with a communal turn, take place in various parts of the country – the people are "figuring out a way to come together."

The Indian National Congress was formed in 1885 against this backdrop, by the educated middle class. Their demands included having more Indians in the industrial sector and protecting economic interests of Indian businesses. These demands were made in a politically moderate fashion, without violent or other extremism.

At this point, Bengal became the site of colonially instigated communal division, in the shape of Lord Curzon's partition of Bengal in 1905. This begat the idea of political partition for the first time in the subcontinent, but the consequent resentment also led to the formation of several regional communities under political symbols. For example, Maharashtra coalesced under the image of Ganpati, Bengal under Durga, and so on. These communities came together in the Swadeshi movement, which eventually led to the rescission of the Bengal partition. However, the Muslim League was also formed among those who approved of the Bengal partition, with the support of Nawab Salimullah, in 1906 in East Bengal.

> The swadeshi movement of 1905–8 has often been seen as the initial coming together and the subsequent parting of ways of moderate and extremist nationalists.

However, the Swadeshi movement had its own internal problems, a prime example of which is the clash between the boycotters of British goods ("the new generation of assertive leaders") and the tradesmen who exploited this movement by raising the prices of indigenously produced goods. At the same time, the annulment of the partition of Bengal was a major success for the nationalist movement, proving that the Swadeshi movement was capable of engendering change.

Culturally, there were several reform movements with widely differing characters – the reformist but strongly casteist ideals of Maharashtrian movements, the Dalit-favouring but Hindu supremacist notions of the Arya Samaj in Punjab, and so on. Dadasaheb Phalke also kick-started the representation of Hindu deities in mass media, by bringing in the technology for lithographs and posters from Germany, eventually leading to the homogenization of the images of these figures across India.

This time period saw major upheavals among Muslim culture as well. This started with the foundation of the AMU by Sir Sayyid Ahmed Khan in 1875. The aim here was the integration of Muslims into the elite, urban middle class, and the conflation of interests across religious lines. However, the ulema was hostile to religious reform and rational approaches to theology.  
Furthermore, the Muslim elite in Bengal and north India resisted the Brtish move to legitimize some waqf boards and not others.
