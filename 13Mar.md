# Borders and Boundaries
General Zia ul-Haq's coup in Pakistan, ending Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's rule, marked the beginning of the Islamicization of the country. The effect of radicalization on women's bodies, seen so clearly during the Partition riots, was exemplified again by his regulations, forbidding western and Indian forms of clothing (saris or jeans). A feminist protest against these measures originated the "aazadi" chant that eventually found its way into Gully Boy's soundtrack.

The Inter-Dominion Treaty and the Act of Recovery illustrate that our narratives of "belonging to the country" are not necessarily narratives of consent. The changing hands of the government on 15th August meant nothing to a large section of the population.

We also see the incompleteness of the picture given by supra-local religious categorization, from Kamlaben's description of Hindu-Muslim relations in Gujarat and Punjab. However, despite the cordiality between the two communities in Punjab, some interviews tell us that they never truly accepted each other even there.
