# Holi, Oxen
Sindh is a rare example of true religious syncretism in the Indian subcontinent, and its inhabitants suffered no bloody Partition (as the region went entirely to Pakistan). The Sindhi identity supersedes religious – and later, national – identities. Sindh is also the birthplace of Indian civilization; not Mughal, and not Brahmin, but an older, more fundamental civilization.

The migration of Hindu Sindhis was distinct from the migration of Punjabi muhajirs; they took the route of the sea from Karachi to Bombay (or to Dubai). The Hindu resident of Sindh (post-Partition) has a fear of radicalization (like that carried out by Zia ul-Haq) and uniformization of Pakistan, and a deep-seated resentment of the migrant Indian Muslim, seen as an usurper of their land.

The literature of Sindhi authors does not, therefore, reflect on violence, rape and blood, but rather on loss, separation and longing.

Holi is, in origin, a ritual of burning winter stocks and celebrating spring. It is not religious; it is co-opted as a religious symbol only after Partition. The story *Holi* uses the festival as a symbol of the syncretism of Sindh, and the longing of Sindhis for their homeland.

*Oxen* immediately contrasts with *Holi* in its comparison of the old with the new, and its description of the transition. The story depicts how animals accustomed to their surroundings and their conditions are unable to live the same way when uprooted – mirroring the human experience.
