# Raavi ke Us Paar
The beginning of the story, set in a gurdwara, reveals (as *Mammo* did) the community aspect of religious spaces. The sole purpose of a place of worship is not just a place to connect with the Lord, but also a place to be part of a community, to give and receive aid.

The actions and decisions of the character put them in a place at the edge of reason and rationality, which line we see has been crossed in stories like *Kafer* and *Toba Tek Singh*. An early foreshadowing of this is Darshan Singh's mother insisting on staying behind in Lyallpur, unable to leave her hometown.

The twins that had such a tumultous life can be seen as symbols of the new-born countries, India and Pakistan, both in chaos and struggling to survive from the very instant of their birth. Shahni also says of one child that "he [would] not drink milk without his brother" – the twins cannot survive without being together.

The use of the word "bundle" to refer to the baby at the end of the story is a mark of the coping mechanisms of the mind. In a situation where a person has to throw their own weeks-old, dead child into a river, a decision that has to be made in the seconds that it took for the train to cross the river, he has to adjust his mind to think of what he is discarding as nothing more than a "bundle" – no longer a child, a baby, or a son.

# Epar Ganga Opar Ganga
This story represents a different use of the symbol of the river from *Raavi ke Us Paar* – a fluid, shifting stream, always in turmoil.

The description of Sudam's wife, Durga, is the epitome of the feminine in the culture of Bengal – the goddess, the mother, and the graceful.

The part of the story before Sudam returns and is told that Durga is dead is intentionally ambiguous. We have no idea about the truth of the statements of the station officers – why Durga died, what happened before, is that what really happened? Her body is not revealed and the story also does not tell us.
