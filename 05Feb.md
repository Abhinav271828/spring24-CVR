# The Interwar Period (contd.)
The 1925 saw the foundation of the RSS, from the parent organisation of the Dharm Sabha. These organisations mostly followed Gandhi, who was the conservative voice in the INC, as against Subhash Chandra Bose and Nehru's radicalism. The Hindu right-wing was opposed to independence, while Gandhi tried to preserve a moderate standpoint.

Gandhi also supported the Khilafat Movement. He preached that Indian Muslims should assist any Muslim state that was undeservedly in peril, and that Hindus should support Muslims in this.

In the late 1920s, the government withdrew its artificial augmentation of the demand for Indian cash crops, while the Depression reduced the profits of Indian businesses as well. Against the backdrop of this major crisis, the all-white Simon Commission was formed for constitutional reform. It allocated more power to the federal government, in the place of the provincial government – the states lose control over their reserves and military, and the governor-general has the power to overrule any state government.  
The Congress boycotted the Simon Commission's proposals, for which the Muslim League offered to help. The Hindu Mahasabha opposed this, and so the Congress rejected this offer. This begins the question of religious representation, leading to Jinnah's two-nation theory, which proposed Muslim-majority *provinces* within a multicultural Indian nation.  
Communal rioting begins around now, with the inception of the idea that the demand for Muslim representation was somehow "anti-national."

In 1935, the Government of India Act defined provincial electorates, another instance of colonial social engineering. All government departments were brought under the control of elected Indian ministers, while British officials and the governor retained the right to dismiss these elected governments. This structure of governance is preserved in modern India as well.

In 1937 (where 37 million people voted), Congress contested the elections, winning in all the eight British-governed provinces and forming governments there. Even up till now, Muslim sympathies are mainly with the INC.  
However, they resigned from all states in WWII, when Indian soldiers were sent to fight on the British side. Rice was withdrawn from Bengal to stop it from falling into Japanese hands – this led to the largest man-made famine in world history, killing 3.8 million people.

This precipitated the Quit India Movement, which was essentially an urban movement that spread towards the hinterlands. The Muslim League, the Hindu right-wing groups and the industrialists stayed away from it.
