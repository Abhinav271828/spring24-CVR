# The 1937 Election and WWII
In the late 30s and early 40s, the idea of an independent India was taking shape. Many involved players had different structural conceptions of the country for the postcolonial period. While some vague notion of federalism was consistent across all these, the degree of separation of power and dominance of the centre over the provinces was a major point of contention.

When the war started, the Cripps Mission was undertaken to persuade India to join the war effort. Cripps offered Indian leaders dominion status in return for war aid, but was completely rejected.

The possibility of a centre-strong independent India made Jinnah realise that the interests of Muslims (either in their well-off, minority categories or poor, majority ones) was always in danger of being overridden. He therefore proposed a loose federation of Hindu and Muslim provinces.  
However, the Muslim League won only 4.4% of votes cast in the 1937 elections. Jinnah saw that he had no backing among Indian Muslims, and recast himself in a more practising light. He recruited AMU students as the ML cadre, to spread awareness.
